<h3>Templates</h3>
<p>
    Angular 7 uses the 
    "ng-template" as the tag instead of "template"which is used in Angular2. 
        "ng-template" has been in use since the release of Angular 4 , and the earlier version i.e Angular 2 uses 
            "template" for the same purpose. The reason it started to use 
                "ng-template" instead of 
                    "template" from Angular 4 onwards is because there is a name conflict between the "template"
                         tag and the html "template" standard tag. It will deprecate completely going ahead.
                              This was one of the major changes made in Angular 4 version.
