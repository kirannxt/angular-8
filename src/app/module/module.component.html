<h2> Module </h2>
<p>
Module in Angular refers to a place where you can group the components,
 directives, pipes, and services, which are related to the application.<br/><br/>

In case you are developing a website, the header, footer, left, center and the right section
 become part of a module.<br/><br/>

To define module, we can use the NgModule. When you create a new project using 
the Angular –cli command, the ngmodule is created in the app.module.ts file by default</p>

The NgModule needs to be imported as follows −

<br>

The structure for the ngmodule is as shown below −

<br>
<br>
It starts with @NgModule and contains an object which has declarations, imports, providers and bootstrap.
<br/>
<br>
<b> Declaration </b>
<br>
<br>
It is an array of components created. If any new component gets created, 
it will be imported first and the reference will be included in declarations as shown below −

<br>
<br>

<b>Import</b>
<br>
<br>
It is an array of modules required to be used in the application. 
It can also be used by the components in the Declaration array.
 For example, right now in the @NgModule, we see the Browser Module imported. 
 In case your application needs forms, you can include the module with the below code −

<br>

<br>
<br>
The import in the @NgModule will be like the following −
<br>
<br>
<img src="../../assets/img/module 6.JPG">
<br>
<br>

<b>Providers</b>
<br>
<br>
This will include the services created.
<br>
<br>
<b>Bootstrap</b><br/>
<br/>
This includes the main app component for starting the execution.</p>
