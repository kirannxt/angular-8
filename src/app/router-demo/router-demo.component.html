<h4>Routers</h4>

<p>Routing basically means navigating between pages. You have seen many sites with links that direct you to a new page.
     This can be achieved using routing. Here the pages that we are referring to will be in the form of components.
      We have already seen how to create a component. Let us now create a component and see how to use routing with it.</p>


<h4> Example </h4>

<nav> 
   <a routerLink = "/Home">Home</a> 
   <a routerLink = "/routersnew">Index </a> 
</nav>
